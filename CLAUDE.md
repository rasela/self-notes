# self-notes

A personal knowledge base of self-study notes, published as a static site. Each
note is **one HTML file plus the shared shell** (`shared.css` + `shared.js`,
no build step). The site is hosted on a static host that reads
`_redirects` for short URLs (Netlify-style).

## How it works

- **`index.html`** — the landing page. A searchable grid of cards, one card per
  note. The card list is the source of truth for "what notes exist." It is
  self-contained (does not use the shared shell).
- **`<note>.html`** — one file per note. Links `shared.css` (before its inline
  `<style>`) and `shared.js` (before its inline `<script>`). No other external
  JS/CSS except Google Fonts.
- **`shared.css`** — the common page shell: tokens (incl. default purple
  accent), reset, grain, progress bar, nav, TOC drawer, back-to-top, footer.
  Pages override tokens/rules in their inline `<style>`, which always loads
  after the link — page CSS wins at equal specificity.
- **`shared.js`** — the shell behaviour: progress bar, drawer
  (open/close/Esc/overlay, smooth-scroll `data-a` links), tap-to-toggle
  `.check`/`.night` checklists, back-to-top. Every feature is guarded, so
  pages missing an element (e.g. no `#prog`) can still use it.
- **`_redirects`** — short-URL → file mappings, e.g. `/obe /abtb.html 200`.
- **`search.js` + `search-index.json`** — client-side **semantic search** on
  `index.html`, 100% in the browser (no server, no key). `search.js` loads a
  small embedding model (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, ~23MB, cached after first
  load) via transformers.js WASM from a CDN, embeds the query, and ranks it
  against the prebuilt `search-index.json`. Shows a "Content Matches" panel of
  article-level hits that deep-link to `note.html#id`. The old keyword
  card-filter still runs for short queries; failure degrades to it silently.
- **`tools/`** — the **offline indexer** (`build-search-index.mjs` +
  build-only `package.json`). Kept OUT of the repo root on purpose so the host
  never auto-installs `node_modules` into the published site.
- **`README.md`** — intentionally minimal.

No framework or bundler. The only package.json is `tools/` (build-only, not
served). "Build a page" = edit HTML. "Deploy" = commit + push (host serves the
repo root). Search index is prebuilt and committed — see the rebuild step below.

## Adding a new note (the standard flow)

When the user drops a markdown/source file and says "add this note":

1. **Create `<slug>.html`** in the repo root, following the page spec below.
   Pick a slug that's short and memorable (`obe-taxonomy.html`).
2. **Add a card to `index.html`** — copy an existing `<a class="note-card">`
   block inside `#notesGrid` (just before the `ADD MORE NOTES` comment) and set
   `href`, `data-title`, `data-tag`, `data-desc`. The card's inner HTML is
   rendered from those data-attributes by the script at the bottom — don't write
   inner markup. `data-title` uses Bebas Neue so keep it short (≈2 words).
3. **Add 1–2 redirects** to `_redirects` for nice short URLs.
4. **Rebuild the search index** so the new note is searchable:
   `cd tools && npm install && npm run index` (regenerates `../search-index.json`;
   the model is cached after first run). Commit the updated `search-index.json`.
5. **Commit on a branch + open a PR** (do this by default once the change is
   complete, unless the user explicitly says not to) — see the workflow under
   *Conventions* below, and share the Netlify deploy preview link.

Leave the user's original source file (e.g. in `~/Downloads`) untouched.

## Existing notes

`index.html` (grid) · `morning-routine.html` · `options-mm-guide.html` ·
`dark-psychology.html` · `focus-10.html` · `protocol.html` · `abtb.html`
(Buhlman OBE) · `obe-taxonomy.html` · `phasing.html` (Kepple/Tasker) ·
`lucidology.html` (Newport) · `gurriaran.html` (stance layer) ·
`absorption.html` / `footprint.html` (orderflow) · `beats.html` (binaural
session player).

Topics cluster into OBE/astral practice (focus-10, protocol, abtb, obe-taxonomy,
phasing, lucidology, gurriaran, beats) and trading (options-mm-guide,
absorption, footprint), plus standalone notes.

`lucidology.html` is the one themed exception: it keeps its own night-sky CSS
inline (no `shared.css`) but still uses `shared.js` for the drawer.

# Page structure spec

The canonical template is **`abtb.html` / `absorption.html`** — match these for
any new note. All pages (including the former legacy trio) now sit on the
shared shell + house style.

The fastest way to build a new note: **duplicate `abtb.html`, swap the accent
color, content, and TOC.** Everything below describes what that template already
does, so changes stay consistent.

## Non-negotiables

- **Mobile-first.** Design for a phone screen first; these are read on mobile.
  Single column, generous tap targets (≥40px), `-webkit-tap-highlight-color`
  cleared on interactive rows. Desktop only adds hover affordances inside a
  `@media(min-width:640px)` block — never a separate desktop layout.
- **One content file + the shared shell.** Shell (nav, drawer, progress,
  back-to-top, tokens) comes from `shared.css`/`shared.js`; everything
  page-specific (accent, components, content scripts) stays inline in the
  note's own `<style>`/`<script>`. No other dependencies beyond Google Fonts.
  No external images — use inline SVG or CSS.
- **Self-contained navigation** — every page links back to `index.html`.

## Required structure (top to bottom)

1. **`<head>`** — `<meta viewport width=device-width, initial-scale=1>`, a
   descriptive `<title>` (`"Topic — Subtitle"`), Google Fonts preconnect +
   stylesheet, **`<link rel="stylesheet" href="shared.css"/>`**, then the
   inline `<style>` with the page's `:root` token overrides (at minimum the
   accent) + page-specific styles. The shell rules live in `shared.css` —
   don't re-declare them unless the page intentionally deviates.
2. **Grain overlay** — `body::before` fixed fractal-noise SVG at low opacity
   (the subtle texture every page shares).
3. **Reading-progress bar** — `#prog`, fixed under the nav, fills on scroll.
4. **Fixed top nav** (`height:52px`) — left `.brand` label, right `.hbtn`
   hamburger that animates to an X.
5. **Slide-in TOC drawer** (`.drawer` + `.overlay`) — opens from the right.
   One `.toc-list` link per section with a small `.toc-tag` glyph, plus a
   `← All notes` back-link to `index.html`.
6. **`<main>`** (`padding-top:52px` to clear the nav):
   - **`.hero`** — `.eyebrow` (source/author), big serif `h1` (with an italic
     `<em>` accent word), `.subtitle`, optional `.seq` badge row.
   - Optional **`.warn` banner** for the single most important caveat.
   - **`.wrap`** (`max-width:680–720px; margin:0 auto`) containing
     `<article class="technique">` sections, each with a `.tech-head`
     (`.tech-title` + `.tech-abbr` kicker), separated by `.div` diamond dividers.
   - **`<footer>`** — small-caps credit line + a few cross-links to sibling notes.
7. **Back-to-top FAB** (`#btt`), bottom-right, appears after scrolling.
8. **`<script src="shared.js"></script>`** at the very bottom — provides the
   progress bar, drawer open/close (+ Esc + overlay click), smooth-scroll TOC
   links (offset ~64px for the nav), tap-to-toggle checklists, and back-to-top.
   Any page-specific behaviour goes in an inline `<script>` after it.

## Table of contents — requirements

- Lives in the right-hand drawer, opened by the hamburger; closes on link tap,
  overlay tap, or Esc.
- One entry per top-level `<article>` section, in document order, each with a
  short glyph tag (`◷ ① ⚡ ◆ ✓` etc.).
- Links use `data-a="<section-id>"` and smooth-scroll with a nav offset; section
  `id`s must match.
- Always ends with `← All notes` → `index.html`.

## Type, color & spacing tokens

Defined once in `:root`; reuse them, don't hardcode values.

- **Fonts:** `--serif: 'Lora'` for body/headings (readable long-form),
  `--sans: 'Inter'` for UI/labels/captions, optional `--mono: 'JetBrains Mono'`
  for tags/numbers. Body copy is serif at `clamp(16px,4.5vw,18px)` with
  `line-height:1.85` — prioritize readability over density.
- **Dark theme:** near-black `--bg` (#08–0a), slightly lighter `--bgc` card
  surface, hairline `--border: rgba(255,255,255,.07)`. Text ramps
  `--tp` (primary) → `--ts` (secondary) → `--tm` (muted).
- **One accent per note** (`--acc`) picked to fit the topic — purple for OBE
  (#a78bfa), teal for orderflow (#34d3c4) — plus a shared `--gold` (#c9a96e) for
  secondary emphasis. Semantic extras (`--red`/`--green`) as needed. Swapping
  `--acc` is the main thing that re-themes a duplicated page.
- **Spacing/padding:** page gutters `16px`; content column capped at
  `680–720px` and centered; cards/callouts pad `~14px 16px`; sections spaced
  `~44px` apart. Comfortable, airy — never cramped.
- **Touch & motion:** rounded corners (4–6px), 1px borders, subtle
  `fadeUp`/`fu` entrance animations, transitions ~.2–.4s. Interactive elements
  get `:active` states (mobile) and `:hover` only behind the 640px media query.

## Reusable content blocks (already styled in the template)

`.tip` (accent-topped callout) · `.note` (gold-left callout) · `.caution`
(red-left warning) · `.steps`/`.step` (numbered) · `.rows`/`.row` (table
replacement — never use `<table>`, they don't reflow on mobile) · `.stages`
(staged list) · `.signals`/`.sig` (pill chips) · `.checklist`/`.check`
(tap-to-check) · `.div` (diamond divider). Prefer composing these over inventing
new components.

# Conventions for working in this repo

- **Branch → PR → Netlify preview is the default workflow.** Before starting
  any change, cut a fresh branch off the **latest** `main`/`master`
  (`git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`, then `git checkout -b <branch>`).
  Never commit work directly to `main`. When the change is complete, push the
  branch and **open a PR** (`gh pr create`) — do this by default, don't wait to
  be asked. Co-author trailer is added automatically. Only skip the
  branch/PR/push when the user explicitly says not to.
- **Surface the Netlify Deploy Preview.** Netlify builds a deploy preview for
  every PR. After opening the PR, share the preview URL so the change can be
  reviewed live (it shows up as the Netlify "Deploy Preview" check / bot comment
  on the PR — read it back with `gh pr view <n> --comments` or the checks list
  once the build finishes, and paste the link in your reply).
- The **shared shell** (`shared.css`/`shared.js`) holds only what is identical
  on every page — shell chrome and behaviour. Content components (`.tip`,
  `.steps`, heroes, page scripts) stay inline per note so each page can evolve
  independently. When changing `shared.*`, remember it affects **every** page —
  prefer a per-page inline override for one-off tweaks.
- When editing `index.html`, only touch the card block + data-attributes; the
  render script and search already handle the rest.
- Match the voice of the source note (these are the user's personal study notes,
  often first-person) — don't sanitize it into generic prose.
